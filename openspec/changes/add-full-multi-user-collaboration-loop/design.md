## Context

See `proposal.md` for motivation. The clean recovery baseline is the user's personal Fork `origin/gui@e0038b8c7109390445dccb691052fec74a153c09`. It already contains C's OIDC/PKCE, canonical `/v1/me`, Device lease and cloud-authenticated Principal path, the collaboration contracts/server/domain package, and the provider-neutral Content Space/OpenContent packages, but it does not yet compose those pieces into one real file-bearing Project path.

The donor branches are not merge bases:

- A `29256050` contains useful binding/file-intent/execution-fence shapes, but regresses to anonymous pairing, models binding as persisted authorization scopes, and leaves production binding verification uninjected.
- B `543042e9` contains useful coordinator UI, local acceptance/recovery and Worker runner behavior, but duplicates OIDC material into collaboration storage, uses 0.2 contracts against a 0.1 server, and injects `productionMockContentSpace()`.
- C is already integrated in the baseline at `3f5527d1`; its Device revalidation and stable Principal behavior remain canonical.
- E1 `0d370464` contains useful generic system transfer, Workspace safety and receipt work, but its metadata ancestry observation must not be treated as Provider ACL.

All donor code is therefore reviewed by behavior and rewritten behind final package contracts. The previous `codex/full-collaboration-loop` branch and local WIP snapshot are read-only audit/donor sources, are never merged as integration history, and do not establish implementation progress. The recovery branch `codex/full-collaboration-loop-recovery` is the sole integration mainline. The existing A test deployment is the live PoC upgrade baseline under the reversible blue-green rules in Decision 11; it is not a production environment or a donor implementation baseline.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- One canonical OIDC → User → Device → configured Runtime → Agent chain and one token-free Cloud request path.
- One Cloud-authoritative collaboration state machine with durable revision, idempotency, execution fencing, Inbox and recovery.
- One Owner-Desktop-orchestrated Project content saga using ordinary Content Space operations and a Device-signed fact attestation.
- One real Worker file path using the executing User's Provider Connection, operation-time Provider authorization and bounded Workspace transfer.
- Independently ownable domain packages discovered through manifests/generated composition in the source application.
- A reproducible, reversible blue-green upgrade of the existing A test deployment and a fixed evidence script that does not constrain product dynamism.

**Non-Goals:**

- Performing an unbacked in-place mutation of the running A Cloud database, Keycloak realm, edge configuration, or containers.
- Productionizing email verification, MFA, signature notarization, public release policy or complete disaster recovery.
- Making Cloud Project Membership an OpenContent ACL, synchronizing Provider and Cloud databases, or deleting Provider content on Project lifecycle changes.
- Introducing a Cloud-hosted LLM, collaboration-specific Agent Runtime, provider-specific Host switch, shared Provider credential, file sync/mount, or second content execution path.
- Treating the five acceptance users, output names or OpenContent as hard-coded product limits.
- Implementing provider-neutral Shared Documents or real-time co-editing; this PoC uses Content Space file handoff/review and Provider-native operations only.
- Refactoring historical architecture or secret findings outside the production paths changed for this collaboration loop.
- Developing Computer Use TS/Python, Evidence DAG, Project DAG, Create Loop, Remote SSH, or unrelated Worker capabilities; only a minimal generic adapter is allowed if a changed collaboration contract would otherwise fail to compile.

## Decisions

### 1. Package ownership follows business authority, not the demo screen

| Package/context | Owns | Explicitly does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domain-identity-access` | OIDC/token custody, current Principal, Device enrollment/status, Device signing, Agent credential bootstrap/custody, token-free User/Agent Cloud transport | Project, Task, Agent Project role, Provider identity |
| collaboration contracts/server | User/Agent/Project/Membership/Task/Execution/Inbox/Record, revisions, idempotency, persistence and authorization | Desktop Runtime, Provider calls, credentials |
| `domain-collaboration` | Runtime configuration, Agent facts/status projection, token-free presence/WSS consumption, durable local Inbox/outbox, local acceptance policy and execution journal | OIDC Token, Agent machine credential, Coordinator business UI, Provider implementation |
| `domain-project-coordinator` | Project/plan/Worker selection/Task/review/recovery HCI and Project content saga orchestration | OIDC/Provider credential, Cloud repository, vendor client |
| `domain-content-space` | Provider-neutral resources, Broker authorization, ordinary/admin/system transfer capabilities, Workspace byte boundary and receipts | Project aggregate, Cloud membership, vendor credentials |
| OpenContent packages | Provider account binding, private credentials/transport, exact Team/file semantics and real Provider observation | SciForge User/Project/Task authority |
| Host/Domain SDK | Generic composition, Principal injection, capability governance, Device signature and Workspace ports | Domain IDs, provider switches or collaboration workflows |

Backend and renderer contributions of one business domain remain in one package/version with separate explicit entrypoints. `domain-collaboration` and `domain-project-coordinator` compose into one GUI through standard renderer contributions; the Host imports neither package implementation.

Alternative rejected: put all UI and runtime behavior in `domain-collaboration`. That would couple login/connection ownership to Coordinator planning and prevent independent release/testing.

### 2. Identity contributes a token-free authenticated transport

The implementation reuses Domain SDK's generic owner-scoped, main-only internal-service mediation. `domain-identity-access` owns and publishes the authenticated Cloud transport contract; its public request contains only a registered operation ID, strict bounded body and abort signal, never a caller-selected route, method or header. `domain-identity-access` resolves the current OIDC session, validates Device continuity, injects authorization in its private boundary, executes the canonical operation and returns a strict token-free response. Collaboration packages receive neither headers nor session material. Keeping the domain-specific contract with its owner avoids turning Domain SDK into a collaboration API and avoids unrelated package-version coupling.

Agent machine credentials remain cryptographically separate from OIDC material, but their bootstrap, decryption, native persistence and Bearer injection belong to the same Identity private runtime. After the Agent is registered to the current OIDC User and exact ACTIVE Device, collaboration consumes only strict token-free Agent command, Inbox and WSS methods plus non-secret credential status; it never receives the sealed bootstrap private key or replayable credential. Pairing uses the User-authenticated transport and binds only a Human endpoint.

Alternative rejected: B's collaboration-owned OIDC session broker, Agent credential store or direct authenticated Cloud client. Any of them creates a second credential owner and makes logout, Device revoke and Agent rotation races ambiguous.

### 3. Agent bootstrap is a guarded state machine

Desktop bootstrap order is:

`oidc_user_ready → device_active → runtime_configured → agent_registered → collaboration_connected`.

OpenContent 的固定测试 Provider endpoint 是 Connector package-owned、`publicRelease: allowed`
的公开配置，必须随正常 Git clone 和 package tarball 到达；它不是 credential、Skill、私有
sidecar 或 Stage 4 授权输入。五人源码验收中唯一需要私下分发的 OpenContent 文件是可选的
`opencontent-base.zip` Agent Skill。

The Device installation identity is stable; Agent identity is Cloud-issued for `(userId, deviceId)` and Run-0 permits one active Agent per Device. Runtime/model selection is local and may change without changing Agent identity. Availability reports capability tags and readiness, never credentials.

每次成功的 Agent heartbeat 都把 Identity 从 canonical Host Runtime readiness 观察到的 capability tags
写入精确 Agent revision。后续 Worker availability 发布必须 CAS 该 revision，并与其中的
connection status、last-seen heartbeat 和完整 capability-tag set 一致；Cloud 拒绝调用方替换或
伪造这些 heartbeat facts。Worker 本地 durable journal 在收到 offer 和进入任一终态时刷新 active
Task count；Runtime readiness 不可用时 availability 不接受新 offer，automatic preflight 在发送
accept 前以 `runtime_not_ready` fail closed。

全局 availability 行保持 Project-independent。Provider principal、Membership、Task Authority 和
当前 Project content readiness 仍是相互独立的 Cloud facts，只在 Project-scoped Worker view 中嵌套
组合并显式报告 principal snapshot 的 `match | missing | stale`，不复制成另一套全局授权状态。

Logout, Device revoke, ownership conflict or unconfirmable Device state moves Cloud authority to unavailable, stops connection and file work, and fences active executions. Local offline features remain governed separately.

Alternative rejected: create an Agent immediately after login. An Agent with no executable Runtime would advertise false capacity and create orphaned machine credentials.

### 4. Collaboration server keeps explicit orthogonal state

The database stores four independent facts instead of a composite “member is authorized” boolean:

- `project_membership`: `pending_membership | active | membership_removal_pending | removed`.
- `provider_membership_observation`: the latest external member-list or operation fact observed from the Provider, with no Cloud authority.
- `project_content_readiness`: the derived per-Project, per-User projection `missing_identity | pending | ready | degraded` for one binding revision.
- `task_authority`: derived at command time from Project/Membership/Device/Agent/execution facts; live executions carry a durable fence.

`project_content_binding` separately tracks `provisioning | active | degraded | closed` with a provisioning revision. Its initial `provisioning` row exists in the atomic Project-create transaction with a null root and null attestation, because the external Provider container does not exist yet. The same binding receives the exact portable root and attestation digest only when Device-signed provisioning succeeds; `active` and `degraded` bindings always retain those facts. Project lifecycle status and binding status are separate fields; neither is encoded as a slash-composite status.

Task rows hold a required Worker User and capability tags while a User-level Offer is pending; no Agent, Device or execution is preselected. Cloud broadcasts the Offer to every currently eligible runtime owned by that User. The first eligible Device claim creates and binds one immutable execution attempt in the same compare-and-set transaction; subsequent claims observe the winner. Old executions remain audit facts but all writes check the current execution/fence and expected revision. Outbox/Inbox and each state transition commit in one database transaction. WSS only signals availability.

On each Agent connect or reconnect, the Desktop drains the durable Inbox in bounded sequence pages before relying on another WSS hint. After the idempotent handler completes, advancing the local sequence and enqueueing its stable ACK are one local transaction. A crash before that commit replays the message through the same idempotent handler; duplicate pages therefore create neither a second durable business fact nor another ACK. Accept recovery continues the same Cloud execution, and a stable Agent directive reconciles a dispatched Runtime turn rather than creating a second turn or execution.

Alternative rejected: infer Provider permission from Project Member or collapse retry count into the same execution identity. Both allow stale devices to write after authority changes.

### 5. Local acceptance policy is not a Cloud field

`manual | automatic` is stored in `domain-collaboration` package settings keyed by local `agentId`. On a User-level Offer, both modes run the same local preflight. Manual mode exposes claim/local-dismiss HCI; automatic mode sends an explicit claim only after preflight. Local dismiss affects only that Device and never becomes a Cloud User-level rejection. Cloud sees only the first successful claim and creates the exact Agent/Device execution at that point.

Alternative rejected: A Cloud `acceptancePolicy` field. It would become a cross-device policy and claim knowledge of local Runtime/Provider state that Cloud does not own.

### 6. Project provisioning is a client-orchestrated durable saga

Before a file-bearing Project exists, each authenticated User publishes one current global `ProviderDirectoryPrincipalFact` for an exact Provider Instance from that User's ACTIVE Device. The fact wraps only a non-authorizing Provider Directory Principal Reference plus User/Device provenance, readiness and compare-and-set revision. One exact User and Provider Instance has one current stable fact; conflicting replacement is explicit and never inferred from email, display name, OIDC subject or Agent ownership.

Cloud then creates the Project, explicit Memberships and exact provisioning intent at revision N in one transaction. The Owner comes from the authenticated OIDC actor rather than a caller-authored field. For Run-0, Cloud derives `contentOwnerUserId = ownerUserId` and selects that Owner's exact ready Provider fact plus every desired Provider member fact by expected revision; the caller cannot nominate a different initial content owner. Stale, degraded, cross-User or cross-Provider facts fail closed. The Owner Desktop's coordinator package obtains one Human confirmation carrying the Host-canonical SHA-256 of the complete, immutable revision-N operation plan. The Broker recomputes the digest over the full parsed plan before turning that exact confirmation into finite, one-use approval proofs for each enumerated Content Space create/list/add/list operation. A missing or mismatched digest consumes and rejects the confirmation, so plan A cannot be replaced by plan B and then retried under the same approval. The result is not a standing administration grant, and any changed member/root/request requires new confirmation.

Each external operation uses the normal Content Space capability and current Owner Provider Connection. The coordinator package journals logical invocation IDs and exact receipts, re-reads the Provider member list, builds a provider-neutral report, and asks Identity/Host to sign the structured digest with the current enrolled Device key. Cloud verifies the Device signature, current Owner/Device, intent revision and report digest before binding and activating the Project.

Failures preserve the journal. Definitive missing operations may continue; uncertain writes require observation. No failure path deletes the external Team/directory. Dynamic add/remove is the same saga with a new revision. Removal first fences Cloud task authority and only then attempts Provider removal. A future explicit content-owner transfer is a separate saga executed on the new content owner's Desktop with that Human's current Provider Connection; it is not part of Run-0 and never reuses the old Owner's Provider authority.

Alternative rejected: a Cloud backend calling OpenContent. It would require shared Provider credentials and violate execution-node account authority. Also rejected: a Content Space `provisionProject` method, because Content Space must not import Project semantics.

### 7. Device signature attests observations, not Provider authority

`ProjectContentProvisioningAttestation` contains a version, project/intent/revision, Owner User, Device ID/public-key ID, current Principal identity version, Provider instance and opaque binding revision, exact portable root, normalized operation receipts, member-set digest, issued time and signature. Provider facts are supplied by Content Space; Identity/Host signs a canonical serialization; Cloud verifies with the Device public key stored during enrollment.

The attestation contains no Token, private key, Provider credential/Connection, endpoint or reusable Broker handle. It proves who observed what under which current bindings; subsequent Provider authorization is always re-evaluated at operation time.

Alternative rejected: A's persistent authorization-scope proof. Cloud cannot grant or continuously know Provider ACL, so such a proof would overstate authority.

### 8. Project file execution uses two generic system capabilities

Content Space owns `system-download` and `system-upload-new` as generic system-only capabilities. `domain-collaboration` requests them with an execution-bound portable resource and Workspace-relative path through Domain SDK; it never imports Content Space implementation or receives paths/credentials. A manifest-contributed system-capability grant binds the allowed caller, exact operation IDs and no wider content family.

The sole Worker runner is the canonical task adapter owned by `domain-collaboration`. It durably binds one current Cloud execution before effects, invokes the generic Agent execution Host with one stable directive ID, exact execution Workspace and Project/Task/execution metadata, and journals the observed Runtime terminal identity/state. A strict `needs_human` Runtime result creates the unified `worker_execution` HumanNeeded for that execution's Worker User; the target User's authenticated HumanAnswer resumes the same execution, Workspace and Runtime Session. If Desktop stops after Cloud commit but before linking the returned `humanRequestId`, the one delivered durable outbox response is the only recovery source and must match the exact Project/Task/execution/Agent/target-User answer tuple. Because Cloud advances Task/execution revisions around this exchange, the Worker may reconcile one denial containing revision-mismatch reasons only, then immediately re-run the full preflight with the exact current revisions; any simultaneous authority denial remains terminal. File effects use only the generic Content Space system contracts with the same exact system execution context; no Runtime-specific client, Project-coordinator runner, legacy Task transition, ResourceRef write facade or Content Space implementation port is retained.

For download, metadata proves identity/ancestry only; OpenContent `DownloadCheck` runs before Host opens the local destination. For upload, the real no-overwrite Provider write is the final ACL check. Both transfers enforce byte bounds and return receipts bound to the exact operation and resource identity. Implementations may retain byte counts or content digests as non-secret diagnostics, but per-file bytes/SHA-256 are not a Run-0 completion gate in this PoC. Production composition has no mock factory.

Content Space admits a `poc_only` invocation from the trusted Broker audience, exact current Principal/authority and the pinned Provider's live Binding Attestation; the Connector recomputes that binding immediately before dispatch. There is no static verification-profile contract, package contribution or local authorization-package generator. The separately delivered `opencontent-base` Agent skill is optional Workspace data: ordinary and Team OpenContent Provider operations remain usable without it, while a provider-neutral verifier/installer may place a private ZIP into `.codex/skills/<skill-name>` without executing it or publishing its bytes. Installing a skill never creates a Provider Connection or changes readiness/authority.

Alternative rejected: B's `productionMockContentSpace()` and E1's metadata-as-ACL interpretation. Both can report success after the real member has lost access.

### 9. External write uncertainty is reconciled, never guessed

Every external write has one stable logical invocation ID and durable journal state: `prepared | dispatched | observed_success | observed_failure | outcome_unknown | abandoned`. A timeout after dispatch becomes `outcome_unknown`; no automatic retry is allowed. Coordinator recovery invokes canonical observation against the exact parent/name/digest. An exact observed output can be linked with Human provenance even when its preserved Runtime observation is older than the ordinary 24-hour submission window; otherwise the old execution is abandoned, including while the Content binding is degraded. The recovery retry remains default-visible to the Owner, but Human interaction only approves the action: the current Coordinator Agent issues the successor command, Cloud creates a new `executionId`, and only that Coordinator successor/revision command may replace the safe output name while every other file-intent fact remains unchanged. The abandoned execution remains permanently fenced, and neither the same filename nor any historical Task filename may be reused.

Terminal execution and membership events immediately fence the matching local run and abort its active Runtime/transfer signal. A Runtime or Provider result that still arrives is retained as a late observation with its exact logical invocation, but it is never copied into current outputs or submitted as a TaskResult. Once the local fence is durable, the Desktop does not attempt a new Cloud observation write on that lost execution authority. Duplicate late observations converge on the same local journal fact. A normal Desktop shutdown instead leaves an in-flight Agent invocation `dispatched`, so restart reconciles the same stable directive.

Alternative rejected: retry with the same or a generated idempotency key when the Provider does not guarantee idempotency. That can create duplicate content or overwrite Human-visible state.

### 10. Coordinator HCI is a projection over authoritative commands

Every current Coordinator Agent is owned by the Project Owner. The authenticated Owner Human operates the Coordinator HCI, and Coordinator transfer may select only another exact Agent owned by that same Owner; Workers are selected as dynamic Project-member Users, while an exact Worker Agent/Device exists only inside a claimed Task Execution.

The coordinator renderer consumes strict read projections and emits commands with expected revision/idempotency. Creating a Project returns and focuses its ID; plan confirmation, HumanNeeded and review cards are visible without entering a collapsed advanced region. Worker candidates are one row per User; Agent/Device facts may explain current dispatchability but are never selection values. Review provides accept/request-revision, and recovery exposes only evidence-backed actions.

The local Plan editor changes the complete reviewable task content and Worker User assignments before immutable submit. Planner input exposes each User's anonymous per-Runtime profiles, with capability tags and eligible Task scopes kept in the same profile entry; facts from different Runtimes are never unioned into an impossible profile. A newly created Project is paused and therefore carries suspended Task Authority until its Plan is confirmed. During this planning-only state, text scope and fully ready file scope are projected from the exact membership/content facts that activation will use, instead of requiring the currently suspended authority and creating a circular dependency. Draft generation, assignment edits, and a fresh pre-submit read still require one online, ready Runtime owned by the selected User to satisfy the complete Task capability/content requirements. After confirmation activates the Project, Offer creation and Device claim revalidate current Task Authority and exact Agent/Device readiness. Review CAS facts are derived from the currently visible Project/Task/execution/result revisions. Final completion is shown only for a confirmed Plan whose current Tasks each have one accepted current result and whose shared ProjectRecord memory contains a decision sourced from the exact target User's HumanAnswer; it submits the exact accepted result IDs and final summary atomically.

Plan generation is structurally constrained at the Runtime boundary rather than relying on prompt wording. Project Coordinator supplies a bounded provider-neutral JSON Schema for the exact canonical Plan task fields through the generic Agent execution Host; Codex and Claude adapters map it to their native structured-output facility. Portable locator identity is deliberately excluded because provider strict-schema subsets cannot safely express an arbitrary provider-owned identity map. For file tasks the model selects only a bounded `sourceInputIndex` from the exact supplied file choices plus destination/output metadata; main replaces that selection with the exact caller-supplied locator and current active Cloud binding revision. The package then parses the terminal JSON, constructs the canonical file intent, applies its own strict schema, verifies unique item IDs and in-Plan dependency references, and persists only a valid draft. A Runtime that cannot honor structured output fails closed. The directive ID is schema-versioned so retrying the same Project revision after a contract upgrade cannot collide with a durable turn created under the previous prompt/schema. Capability output exposes only `runtime_unavailable | runtime_execution_failed | invalid_structured_output`; provider diagnostics remain main-process causes. Worker User assignment is intentionally absent from generated content and remains a later Human edit.

The UI never directly calls Provider or database APIs. Provisioning and recovery commands route to the package's main orchestrator, which uses generic authenticated Cloud and Content Space capability ports. A result card sends only exact Project/Task/execution/submission/output selection facts to main; main re-reads the current Cloud snapshot and binding before Host materializes the portable output under the live Principal/Workspace. The capability output carries only the non-authorizing `resourceRef`, never the materialized handle. Domain-neutral resource navigation passes that reference to Content Space, which asks Host to rebind it after current caller/audience/Workspace/Principal-lease checks, then alone observes and downloads through the canonical Provider path.

`HumanNeeded` is one strict contract with an explicit scope discriminator and required `targetUserId`. `worker_execution` binds the request to one current unfenced Task execution and targets that execution's Worker User by default; it returns the answer to that Worker as well as the current Coordinator. `coordinator_project` binds only the Project and current Coordinator authority epoch, selects one active Project-member User explicitly, and never invents a Task or execution. Cloud persists one `HumanAnswer`, delivers it to the current Coordinator Agent Inbox, and only that Coordinator Agent may turn the exact target User answer into an official `decision`, later author `summary`, and complete the Project. The target User may answer through authenticated OIDC; a verified Human Endpoint may answer only after Cloud resolves it to the same already-existing target User and the exact Project endpoint. Pairing never creates a User, and an unverified IM string is never a HumanAnswer.

Collaboration owns the durable Agent Inbox transport and exposes one versioned, main-only Coordinator command/Inbox service to the Project Coordinator package. Project creation delivers the canonical `project.started` message to that owner; it routes `coordinator_project` answers to the same package and keeps `worker_execution` answers on the Worker adapter. Absence of the Coordinator owner fails before ACK. The Project Coordinator revalidates the current Coordinator Agent, active answering member User and authority epoch, then writes one decision with a stable HumanAnswer-derived idempotency key. An already visible matching decision is the durable restart proof and suppresses a second write.

Alternative rejected: a single collaboration screen owning Identity, Provider enrollment and Coordinator workflow. It obscures package authority and makes token/provider leakage difficult to audit.

### 11. Run-0 reuses the existing A test issuer through a reversible blue-green upgrade

Run-0 is the first live acceptance run, not a second public DNS/issuer stack. It reuses the healthy A test endpoints `https://cloud-test.sciforge.cn` and `https://login-test.sciforge.cn/realms/SciForge` on `47.76.230.118`; no `cloud-run0`/`login-run0` DNS or second 443 listener is required. The exact currently deployed image/schema/realm/edge facts are revalidated immediately before work rather than trusted from documentation.

Before any mutation, the running Cloud database, Keycloak database/realm configuration, edge configuration and current image metadata are backed up and a restore rehearsal is proven. The current Cloud database is copied into independently named candidate database/volume/container/network resources, forward-only migrations and the recovery-branch image run only on that candidate, and synthetic acceptance identities are used. The existing Keycloak issuer remains canonical; any required realm/client change is separately backed up, bounded and reversible.

Only after candidate migration, health and focused acceptance pass may the existing Caddy `cloud-test` upstream be switched to the candidate. The previous Cloud app/database remain intact as a rollback target until source-application live acceptance completes. Direct mutation of the running database/container, a new issuer fallback, new Run-0 DNS, or an unverified cutover is rejected. This trades environment-isolation purity for delivery speed while retaining reproducibility and rollback.

### 12. Acceptance status is evidence-derived

The acceptance runner records but does not fake Human/device interactions. Source automated suites may use fakes only in their test entries. Live completion requires a verified A candidate/cutover, five independent source-application profiles from one exact commit on at least three machines/VMs, real OIDC/Provider/Runtime interactions, the fixed meeting script and recovery matrix. An unfinished backup/migration/candidate/cutover yields `awaiting_candidate`; insufficient devices yields `awaiting_real_devices`; any failed required gate yields `failed` or `incomplete`, never “complete with caveats.”

The receipt uses fixture labels U0-U4 and redacted entity IDs, but records exact source commit/image/schema and non-secret digests.

### 13. Repository architecture principles are a source acceptance gate

`Repository architecture principles gate` is a mandatory source-application gate for the production paths added or modified by this change, not advisory review text. The exact frozen requirements are: **不得编辑 central feature map、Host 只能依赖通用 SDK、不得保留兼容 shim/双注册、不得写 showcase/provider/domain 硬编码、backend/UI 同包版本，并验证标准 source composition。**

The gate SHALL fail this change if one of its changed production paths requires Host-private routing, imports a domain implementation rather than a generic SDK contract, retains old and new entrypoints together, uses acceptance/provider/domain identifiers to select production behavior, splits one business domain's backend and UI ownership/versioning, or lacks source production-composition evidence. Repository-wide scans MAY report pre-existing findings, but only findings introduced by or directly blocking the changed collaboration path are blockers for this change; they SHALL NOT authorize unrelated historical-debt refactors. Passing unit tests cannot override an in-scope architecture failure.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [The Provider's DownloadCheck or exact upload observation contract differs from current evidence] → freeze strict Connector schemas and characterize the real provider before admitting live operations; keep affected operation fail-closed rather than add a metadata fallback.
- [A single Human batch confirmation could become overly broad] → bind its confirmed digest to the complete immutable provisioning revision and exact ordered operations; reject and consume a mismatched first plan, issue one-use per-operation proofs and invalidate the batch on any drift.
- [Device signing expands Identity/Host responsibilities] → expose only canonical digest signing and public-key verification metadata; keep private keys inside native secure storage and prohibit arbitrary data signing by domain packages.
- [Cloud and Provider membership diverge for extended periods] → display Project Membership, Provider observation, derived Content Readiness and command-time Task Authority independently; fence Task authority first and provide explicit Owner reconcile.
- [A late Provider success occurs after execution fencing] → retain observation in recovery journal but reject Task association until an authorized Human reconciles it.
- [Donor code embeds obsolete contract assumptions] → port behavior behind new public contracts and tests instead of merging commits wholesale.
- [Five-device live validation cannot run locally] → complete code/source gates and mark final status `awaiting_real_devices` until five independent source-application profiles on the real matrix are supplied.
- [The shared A test environment is damaged during upgrade] → verified backups/restores, independently named candidate resources, candidate-only migrations, explicit edge cutover and retained old app/database rollback targets.

## Migration Plan

1. Create `codex/full-collaboration-loop-recovery` from the personal Fork `origin/gui@e0038b8c7109390445dccb691052fec74a153c09`; freeze Context Map, glossary, ADRs, this OpenSpec and acceptance runbook there. The old integration branch and WIP snapshot remain read-only donors and are never ordinarily merged.
2. Add token-free Identity transport and Device signing without changing public server APIs; migrate collaboration Desktop to consume them and delete its OIDC/token path.
3. Evolve collaboration contracts/server with forward-only migrations for execution, membership/readiness and provisioning state; tests include the revalidated current A schema and every prior schema version supported by the candidate upgrade lineage.
4. Add Project coordinator package and manifest composition; port B's useful UI/runner behavior behind current contracts and remove production mock/fallback code.
5. Add Content Space system transfers and OpenContent operation-time checks; port E1 Workspace/receipt behavior while correcting ACL semantics.
6. Revalidate the A test deployment, back up and rehearse restore, clone its Cloud database into independently named candidate resources, migrate/deploy the recovery image there, then switch only the existing `cloud-test` upstream after candidate gates pass.
7. Run focused, full, architecture, generated-composition and source-application tests from one exact commit; no DMG or packaged artifact is required for this project acceptance.
8. Execute the live device/meeting/recovery matrix and seal the redacted receipt on the recovery branch. Only after all gates pass and the User confirms is an upstream PR prepared from that branch.

Rollback before live activity restores the existing Caddy upstream to the retained old Cloud app/database; candidate resources remain evidence until the rollback is verified. After Provider provisioning, rollback also closes Cloud binding and preserves Provider content for Human cleanup. Database migrations are forward-only and run only on the cloned candidate; rollback never down-migrates the old or candidate database.
